[00:15.20] If I die tomorrow
[00:18.67] Could you find it in your heart to sing?
[00:22.03] If my mother cries in sorrow
[00:25.40] Will you help her with the many things
[00:28.47] That she needs from time to time and day to day?
[00:34.46] So, if I die tomorrow
[00:38.12] Will you know exactly what to say today?
[00:58.12] 
[00:54.40] She won't mind the trouble
[00:57.85] She's been through it all before
[01:00.51] I know she'll say, make it a double
[01:04.58] Of her lemon drink
[01:06.61] And before you know
[01:07.97] She'll be laughin' 'bout the times and those old days
[01:14.08] So, if I die tomorrow
[01:17.69] Promise you can walk away okay, okay?
[01:36.19] 
[01:28.87] I hate to think about it
[01:32.20] So, it helps to shout it
[01:35.33] And if you could help me out
[01:37.51] It would mean so much for my peace of mind
[01:42.11] And her heart is careworn
[01:45.28] And ever since I was a newborn
[01:48.40] I pushed aside this worry for the sake of my life
[02:12.90] 
[02:20.15] If I die tomorrow
[02:23.55] Will you let me know I left in peace?
[02:27.15] I begged and I borrowed
[02:30.15] Everybody's love, and they gave for free
[02:33.68] And I wish that I could give it back to them
[02:39.63] So, if I die tomorrow
[02:43.02] Will you give them all the love they lent to me?
