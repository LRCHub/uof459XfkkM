If this was my last day with you
I would silently observe the reflection of this room in your eyes
Hoping to feel present for the first time
If this was my last day here
I would break the glass resting on my skin
That invisibly separates me from this world
And from you
If this was my last day with you
I wouldn't tell you
I would talk to you about my half-finished poems
As if I had the courage to write again
Hoping someday you will finish them
While you might be searching for me
Between the lines
Or trying to forget me
If you notice my voice shaking
While talking to you
Try to ignore it
If you notice my eyes getting blurry
Find comfort in your sudden disappearance
And wait for gravity to reveal you again
If I die tomorrow
I would finally realize that the ambient pain
Is another proof that I'm still alive
You know
I know
The fragility of everything
The fragility of me
I know
You know
That as the sunset approaches
Every time you smile
I die a little bit
I'm sorry I haven't touched you enough
You see, I can only say "I love you"
In silence
You might be angry with me
For hiding it from you
But all I wanted was another normal day with you
If I don't die tomorrow
I will live as if I could
