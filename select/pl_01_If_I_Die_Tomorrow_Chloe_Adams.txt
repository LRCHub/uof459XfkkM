If I die tomorrow
I don't want no more sorrow
I just wanna spend the night with you
With you
Hand on my heart
I'll love you through the dark
If that gives you peace of mind (mind)
Time waits for no one
So if our lives get stolen
At least we've got tonight
Give me your hand to hold
Like it's forever before my body's cold
I need to tell ya
If I die tomorrow
I don't want no more sorrow
I just wanna spend the night with you
Hey, I would live, steal, or borrow
Just for one more tomorrow
I'm gonna waste time like only we do
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I die tomorrow
If I die tomorrow
You'd never tell
We've had our share of hell
But I'd say it's worth the view (view)
So let's drink to us
'Cause nobody's gonna love
You like how I loved you (you like how I loved
you)
Give you your hand to hold (give me your hand to
hold)
Like it's forever
Before my body's cold
I need to tell ya
If I die tomorrow
I don't want no more sorrow
I just want to spend the night with you
Hey, I would live, steal, or borrow
Just for one more tomorrow
I'm gonna waste time like only we do
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I die tomorrow
If I die tomorrow
Then lay me down (lay me down)
In your garden (in your garden)
Forgive mistakes (my mistakes)
Beg my pardon (beg my pardon)
Think of now (think of now)
And how we are when (how we are when)
I am lying in your arms
And I can feel your beating heart
Lay me down
In your garden
My mistakes
Beg my pardon
Think of now (think of now)
And are how we are when (how we are when)
I am lying in your arms
And I can feel your beating heart
If I die tomorrow
I don't want no more sorrow
I just want to spend the night with you
